## MH4F ( Monster Hunter 4 Fighter ) ##

### What is this ###
This is a fighting game engine built using Microsoft XNA. It is using Capcom's Monster Hunter IP. I was interested in handling a larger project and thought this would be a fun thing to tackle. I am not planning on selling it and am not entirely sure I will ever get it to a point where its in a MVP state. 

### Why XNA ###
XNA uses C# which is very similar to java and thus I have a level of comfort with and don't need a lengthy ramp up time. It also allows freedom to develop my own engine as I want to build the engine and care more about the process rather than the end product. 

### Why not Unity or similar ###
What interests me is being able to build a performant and functional fighting game to see if I can rather than having a product to distribute. Using unity or any other game developers suite is not really what I'm interested in. 

In short, XNA gives me just enough and not too much.

### Why a fighting game ###
I chose to make a fighting game for numerous reasons
 
- Easy to do in 2d, I can focus on code rather than art.
- Presents unique set of architectural problems with each engine mechanics rather than focusing on game design problems like level design and such. 
- Design problems like character fighting style and such still presents an interesting design problems
- Has emphasis on performance as it has to be responsive
- I like fighting games and am pretty knowledgeable on the different mechanics

### Design ###

### Contributing ###
This is a personal project and I'm only sporadically updating it. I'm not a game developer nor do I ever intend to do it professionally so I'm not under the assumption my code is actually any good. If you'd still like to contribute then feel free to make a pull request. If its an improvement or new functionality I can review and merge.
