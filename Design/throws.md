Throws
===
I'm assuming one button throws for now. Two button is a bit easier.

### General Rules of Throws ###
 * Opponent must not be in blockstun (and a bit after)
 * Opponent must not be in hitstun (and a bit after)
 * Opponent is invincible a bit after wakeup
 * Certain moves are throw invincible

### Rules of 1 button throws ###

* Cannot be done from a dash
* Done by holding 4 or 6 and pressing heavy
* Is 1 (technically 0) frames
* Tech time is precise
