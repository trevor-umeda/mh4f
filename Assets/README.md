### Git commands ###

Here is a beginners list of git commands that you will need.

Run these commands to check stuff in. (Put the stuff you done up in github)

* git add .
* git commit -m "<Commit message here, put something helpful>"
* git push origin master

For context what that does in basic terms is make git get all files, say its going to get saved, then push it up to github.  

Run these commands to pull stuff out. ( Get new stuff)

* git pull origin master

Some stipulations is to make sure that you have everything checked (committed) in.
